## Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**SuperSam1995/SuperSam1995** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

Hi, I'm currently studying for a PhD at KFUPM in Saudi Arabia, i've recently graduated from KTH in Sweden. 

My previous professional experiences all fall within the domain of AI/ML and Finance so i'm searching to both deepen my understanding of that specific intersection but also anything that allows me to experience neighbouring areas as well. 

You can reach me on my socials linked in my github or you can even shoot me a message on linkedin. 

Besides work i'm a huge FC Barcelona fan and also love a good book or poem.
